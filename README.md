## Release Notes
#### Version 0.2.0 (not yet released)
- Added iOS (>= 5) support<br>
  The plugin turns the app into an location tracking app for the time it runs in the background.

## Using the plugin
The plugin comes without a js interface. Simply add the plugin to your project and the app will run while in background mode.

**iOS 5-6**<br>
The app still runs in background, even if the location service is not active.

**iOS 7**<br>
The location service needs to be enabled.

## Quirks

### The app crashes under iOS
If the app crashes after installing the plugin, make sure that your `*-Info.plist` is valid.
Do to some bugs in cordova or Plugman please reset all occurences like
```xml
<key>NSMainNibFile</key>
<string>

</string>
```
into
```xml
<key>NSMainNibFile</key>
<string></string>
```
